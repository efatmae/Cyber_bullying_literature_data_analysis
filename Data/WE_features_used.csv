of our approach include: (i) a hierarchical structure that
mirrors the structure of a social media session; (ii) levels
of attention mechanisms applied at the word and comment
level, thereby enabling the model to pay different amounts
of attention to words and comments, depending on the con-
text; and (iii) a cyberbullying detection task that also pre-
dicts the interval of time between two adjacent comments.
These characteristics allow the model to exploit the com-
monalities and differences across these two tasks to improve
the performance of cyberbullying detection."
